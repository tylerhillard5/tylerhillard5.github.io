Personal Website

The goal of this website is to create a modern and sleek personal portfolio

In the first steps of this website I researched on whether or not I should make my website from scratch or base it off of a template.
I decided that after reading some developers opinions on this that it was better to not try to re-invent the wheel and use a template that I could modify.
That is what I did and changed numerous aspects of the original template.
This required lots of trial and error as well as researching the libraries that It had preinstalled in the source code.
